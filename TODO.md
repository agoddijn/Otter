# TODO & Wishlist

This file tracks **signals about what's hard** in this codebase. It's a living document that agents update after each contribution.

## How This Works

1. **Agents encounter friction** (missing helpers, unclear patterns, repetitive code)
2. **Instead of fixing immediately**, they add it here with context
3. **Signal accumulates** - Multiple reports indicate priority
4. **When signal count reaches threshold**, someone builds it

## Infrastructure Wishlist

### Pattern: [Name of helper/utility]
**Signal count**: [Number of agents who wanted this]  
**Context**: [What problem does this solve?]  
**Impact**: [How much better would things be?]  
**Proposed location**: [Where should this live?]

---

## Process Improvements Needed

### Area: [Development/Testing/Documentation]
**Signal count**: [Number]  
**Current pain point**: [What's hard right now?]  
**Proposed improvement**: [How could it be better?]

---

## Known Gaps in Documentation

### Topic: [What's not documented well?]
**Signal count**: [Number]  
**What's confusing**: [Specific confusion]  
**Where it should be**: [Which doc file?]

---

## Documentation Refactoring Needed

### Issue: [What makes docs hard to navigate?]
**Signal count**: [Number]  
**Current state**: [Why is this overwhelming/hard to find?]  
**Proposed refactor**: [How could it be reorganized/consolidated?]  
**Impact**: [How much easier would it be to find information?]

**Examples:**
- Information scattered across 3+ files → needs consolidation
- Section too long/verbose → needs compression
- Poor section titles → needs better organization
- Duplicate/contradictory info → needs reconciliation

---

## Notes

- **Signal count = 1**: One agent noticed, maybe anomaly
- **Signal count = 2**: Pattern emerging, worth watching
- **Signal count = 3+**: Clear need, should prioritize
- **When implementing wishlist items**: Remove them from this file, add to CHANGELOG
